Applications that have been tested to work with qc-usb:
-------------------------------------------------------

avifile (0.7-0.7.16): works
[library for creating, processing, and playing back AVI files]
- avirec: works (use "qcset compat=dblbuf" and command line similar to
  avirec -x 352 -y 288 -c 'Uncompressed YUY2' test.avi)
- avicap: does NOT work (overlay capturing directly to framebuffer not supported)

Broadcast 2000c: works
[Non-linear video editing application]

came: not tested

camserv (0.42): works
[Read video and show it as JPEG-images via HTTP protocol in selected port]
- Keeps camera open all the time, and the driver reads frames from
  camera constantly even if nobody would be reading. Causes lot of
  "lost frames" messages and wastes CPU time, but otherwise works fine.
- Start camserv and point mozilla or compatible browser to URL
  http://localhost:9192. Then press reload, which starts displaying video.

camsource (0.6.0): works
[Read video and show it as JPEG-images via HTTP or as video with a Java applet or Mozilla]
- Keeps camera open all the time, and the driver reads frames from
  camera constantly even if nobody would be reading. Causes lot of
  "lost frames" messages and wastes CPU time, but otherwise works fine.

camstream (0.25): works
[display video in a window]
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf". Otherwise camstream displays message
  "there are more buffers requested than MBUF can provide.
  Falling back to non-mmap()ed mode.", however, non-mmap() mode
  doesn't seem to work.

Cinelerra: not tested
[Non-linear video editing application]

effectv (0.3.6): works
[display video in a window with fancy effects]
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf".

fame (0.9.0): does NOT work
[fast realtime video and audio encoder to MPEG-1/4]
- Requires VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420 which is not supported by the driver.

fbtv: not tested

ffmpeg (cvs-2002-10-28): works
[hyper fast realtime video and audio encoder to several formats e.g. MPEG]

gnomemeeting (0.12.2): works
[Videoconferencing application]
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf" (this is gnomemeeting bug)

gqcam (0.9): works
[Video displayer and snapshot taker]
- You must disable automatic brightness control from gqcam
- You should use "qcset compat=torgb" (or gqcam BGR filter)

gstreamer (0.6.0): works
[a framework for streaming media]
- Use command line similar to
  gst-launch v4lsrc ! xvideosink
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf" (this is gstreamer bug)

hasciicam (0.9): works
[Text mode video viewer, can capture to text or html format continuously]
- Keeps camera open all the time, and the driver reads frames from
  camera constantly even if delay between frames is long. Causes lot of
  "lost frames" messages and wastes CPU time, but otherwise works fine.

lavrec (mjpegtools-1.6.0): does NOT work
[Record MJPEG-compressed videos, supports some hardware MJPEG-devices]
- Requires VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420 which is not supported by the driver.

motion (2.6.3): works
[Detect motion, and save frames with motion into separate files]
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf" (this is motion bug, patch to fix is available
  from http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~tuukkat/quickcam/)
- Turn off motion brightness control, "auto_brightness no" in /etc/motion.conf
- Set image size to a supported size (specifically: the default for motion is
  352x288, but in compressed mode the driver supports at maximum 320x240.
  You must use argument -s 320x240 for motion or the images will be corrupted)

motv (3.72): works
[Video displayer and snapshot taker, may come with xawtv]
- Use "qcset compat=16x", otherwise with certain chipsets (e.g. Trident Cyber)
  with Xvideo and window sizes which are not multiple of eight, may display
  corrupted image. This is likely a bug in XFree server.

mpeg4ip (0.9.8): works
[fancy GUI MPEG-4 recording, playback, and streaming over network toolset]

mplayer (0.90): works
[Video displayer and encoder]
- Use command line similar to
  mplayer -fps 7.5 -tv on:driver=v4l:width=352:height=288:outfmt=rgb24
  in normal mode or in compressed mode
  mplayer -fps 15 -tv on:driver=v4l:width=320:height=240:outfmt=rgb24
- MPlayer 0.90rc4 and newer flip the image upside down with outfmt=rgb24,
  outfmt=yuy2 works fine. This bug isn't in 0.90rc2 and older versions.

realproducer: not tested

streamer (3.72): works
[record single frames or video with sound into file, may come with xawtv]
- Gives apparently harmless error message:
  "Oops: can't count up file names any more", nevertheless captures image.

ttv (3.72): works
[Text mode video viewer]

tuxview/dvb-zapping (0.9.4.20020321): does NOT work
- Requires framebuffer support from V4L driver

vgrabbj (0.8.7): works very well
[Grab single frame or frames at specified frequency into same file]
- Opens video device only when grabs image, doesn't stream constantly
- Option -z can be used to discard selected number of frames initially:
  gives time for the driver automatic brightness control to settle.

vic (1:2.8ucl1.1.3): works
[Videoconferencing application]
- Use "qcset compat=dblbuf" (this is vic bug)
- Vic does not detect correctly the supported image sizes of camera:
  in particular, it thinks that compressed mode which supports maximum
  320x240 is actually the "normal" size 352x288, and the button is
  incorrectly enabled. You must select manually "small" image size.

vidcat (0.7.2): works
[capture single frames into file]
- vidcat comes with w3cam

videodog (0.23): works
[simple command line tool for capturing (multiple) images]
- Good documentation

vstream (0.4.5): does NOT work
[fast video+audio capture tool]
- Uses BTTV specific IOCTL BTTV_FIELDNR (800476C2) which is not supported.

w3cam (0.7.2): works
[Read video and show it in browser using Javascript and cgi-program]
- The cgi-program opens and closes the camera for each captured frame,
  so automatic brightness adaptation in the driver doesn't work. Instead,
  disable it and set manually brightness and contrast, e.g.
  qcset adaptive=n keepsettings=y -b 32000 -c 16000

webcam (0.72): works
[capture and upload continuously images via ftp/ssh or just save into file]
- Use the example configuration file shown in the manual page, but remove
  the line containing "input = composite1".
- Keeps camera open all the time, and the driver reads frames from
  camera constantly even if delay between frames is long. Causes lot of
  "lost frames" messages and wastes CPU time, but otherwise works fine.

webcam_server (0.40): works
[Read video and show it as JPEG-images via HTTP or as video with a Java applet]
- Start webcam_serv and point a browser to URL http://localhost:8888.
- Use either "qcset compat=torgb" or (preferably) webcam_serv -x.
- Keeps camera open all the time, and the driver reads frames from
  camera constantly even if nobody would be reading. Causes lot of
  "lost frames" messages and wastes CPU time, but otherwise works fine.
- The shown picture is three frames older than what camera currently sees:
  you must press three times "reload" until the picture is current
  At least partially due to the driver's fault (one frame delay).

wmtv (0.6.5): does NOT work
[display video in a small dockable icon-size window]
- Requires that hardware/driver supports image size scaling, what QuickCam
  does not do.

xawtv (3.72): works
[Video displayer and snapshot taker]
- Use "qcset compat=16x", otherwise with certain chipsets (e.g. Trident Cyber)
  with Xvideo and window sizes which are not multiple of eight may display
  corrupted image. This is likely a bug in XFree server.
